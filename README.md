# Fempkg
FemboyOS's Package manager.
It is inspired by Arch's pacman so if you used it before you should be able to learn it pretty quickly :3  

> [!WARNING]
> Fempkg is still very much in development. Use at your own risk.

## Package files
Fempkg will use Arch's PKGBUILD package description files. Read more about it [here](https://man.archlinux.org/man/PKGBUILD.5)
